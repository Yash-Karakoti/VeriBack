#### Core Demo (2-3 minutes)
1. **Upload Process**: "Let me show you how easy it is to create a verifiable backup..."
2. **Verification**: "Now I'll verify the backup integrity using Filecoin's Proof of Data Possession..."
3. **Recovery**: "And here's how fast recovery works with FilCDN acceleration..."

#### Technical Deep Dive (1-2 minutes)
- Show the developer-friendly SDK integration
- Explain the Filecoin Onchain Cloud architecture
- Highlight the automated payment processing

#### Closing (30 seconds)
"VeriBack transforms backup trust from promises to mathematical proof, giving SaaS companies a competitive advantage in enterprise sales and compliance."

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
- **File Size**: Ensure files are under 100MB for demo
- **Browser Compatibility**: Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Network**: Demo works offline but shows network status

#### Demo Tips
- Have sample files ready (images, documents, small videos)
- Prepare to explain blockchain concepts simply
- Focus on the business value, not just technical features
- Show the mobile responsiveness

### 6. Q&A Preparation

#### Technical Questions
- **How does PDP work?** "Proof of Data Possession ensures storage providers actually have your data"
- **What's Filecoin Warm Storage?** "Faster storage with continuous integrity proofs"
- **How is this different from regular backups?** "Mathematical verification vs. blind trust"

#### Business Questions
- **Who is this for?** "SaaS companies wanting to offer verifiable backups"
- **What's the value proposition?** "Enterprise sales advantage and compliance benefits"
- **How does pricing work?** "Automated billing through Filecoin Pay"

### 7. Next Steps
